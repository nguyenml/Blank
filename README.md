# Blank
This Project is based on blue book but with an intention of targeting a larger user base.

The point of Blank is to write everyday and teach people how to develop healthy habits.

Everyday, the User is given a chance to submit an entry. When the user prompts to begin his/her writing, a timer starts giving them 3 minutes to write anything they want into the view.

A counter keeps track of the days they wrote and days that they skipped. 

Essentially the driving motivation is the and visibility of progress that I will somehow implement too make the journey to a habit easier.
